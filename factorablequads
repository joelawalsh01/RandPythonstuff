### Python3
##This will generate factorable quadratics, given whatever values of a,b, and c you would like to constrain the problems to.
Happy factoring!


def isfactorable(a, b, c):
    if a * c == d * e and (d + e) == b:
        return 1

#set upper and lower boundaries for a, b, c inside of the range() part of the for loops. Change these however you see fit.

    
count = 0

    for e in range (1,11):
        for a in range(1,11):
            for b in range (1,21):
                for c in range (1,11):
                    if isfactorable(a,b,c)==1:
                        count +=1
                         print( a, "x^2 + ", b, "x + ", c, " , Count = ", count)
